### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I wanted to know how to make functions. I learned how to make functions and was able to write functions for the first time. One of the functions that I wrote calculates the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many Aces were dealt.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was a favorite because I learned how to read text from a file. I wrote a function that determines whether a word is a palindrome in part 1 and I've always thought palindromes were interesting. In part 3 I wrote another program that uses text files but this one used them to make animations. I had a lot of fun messing around with it and it was the first time I used chrono.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I got to use GraphicsMagick to create a gradient image. I had wrote code to alter images while learning Java but never expolred it to deeply. However, it is something that interests me and I had a good time figuring out how to use it in this way. 

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because I didn't know that pseudo random number generators weren't so random and making them even more random was enjoyable. I also didn't really understand seeding too well but doing this lab cleared that up for me. I also had a bit of fun playing the hilo game after finishing the lab.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was a favorite because I got to use GraphicsMagick again. This time, to create a gif. I had to use a lot of the things I had learnt in past labs and figuring out how to get everything to work was a bit confusing but finally solving it felt good.
